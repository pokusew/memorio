    As for fixing the original issue, the strategy is to read the mutable value in useEffect.
    If it changed since the value captured during render, setState.

    How do I implement getDerivedStateFromProps?
    While you probably don’t need it, in rare cases that you do (such as implementing a <Transition> component), you can update the state right during rendering. React will re-run the component with updated state immediately after exiting the first render so it wouldn’t be expensive.
