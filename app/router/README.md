# Routing

Custom solution for roting. It is inspired by [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
and [Redux-First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router).

The main goals of this custom solution are:
* simplicity
* leverage possibilities of the native
  [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)


## TODO

* add support for full URL capabilities (query string, hash)
* add support for history state data
* add support for PayloadTransformer
