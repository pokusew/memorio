# Forms

Custom solution for forms in React. It is inspired by [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/).

The main goals of this custom solution are:
* performance (eliminate unnecessary re-renders)
* leverage native HTML5 forms possibilities (validation, ...)
* dynamic declarative fields registration and de-registration
* make values of all fields available in `onSubmit` handler
